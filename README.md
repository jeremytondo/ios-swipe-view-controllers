# iOS Swipe Page View Controller Sample

This is a simple example of how you can use a page view controller to swipe between different view controllers using storyboard.

This is based off the tutorial found here http://www.appcoda.com/uipageviewcontroller-storyboard-tutorial/ but I have modified it to allow you to add new view controllers right in storyboard and use those rather than adding them programatically.

This sample uses Storyboard IDs and an array of StoryBoard IDs in MasterViewController.m to allow you to easily add as many view controllers as you want.
